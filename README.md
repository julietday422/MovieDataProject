## General Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to find trends in movie data that will allow Microsoft to decide what kind of movies to make at their new Microsoft studio. Since Microsoft is just getting into the movie business, they need actionable insights to decide what kind of films to create.

## Business Problem
As a business, Microsoft's goal is to make money. With so many attributes to a successful movie, Microsoft needs to know what kind of movie to make and how to make it, in order to earn a net profit.

This data will explore that question from three angles:
1. Runtime
2. Time of year the movie is released
3. Production budget

## Source of Data
The data used for this analysis came from two sources: The Movie Database (TMDB) and The Numbers (TN).

The TMDB data was used to analyze runtime, with a total of 4,766 data points used after cleaning the data. This data was collected from a dataset on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

The TN data was used to analyze the movie's premiere month and production budget, with a total of 5,782 data points. This data was collected from a dataset provided by the Flatiron School.

Both TMDB and TN are reliable data sources that provide movie insight based on a variety of factors.
